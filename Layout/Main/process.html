<p margin="50">Think of this as a sort of commentary. It’s not gonna be in French, and I’ll be using a very conversational tone. I won’t do much revising as I go (future me clocking in: this took about an hour to write, and I don't plan on editing it), and this is gonna be a stream-of-consciousness sort of deal, so, if you really do want to read this, don’t be expecting my magnum opus. You can look elsewhere for that, under the section “Mauvais Acte 2.” If you’re just here to have some laughs or be polite, maybe don’t read this bit, because there’s some rambly personal stuff (not to mention my unstomachably florid writing style) here that I just want to get out there so that it gets out there, whether it gets read or not. It’s the principle of the thing, the idea that theoretically anyone can read this, that excites me.</p>

<p margin="50">My creative process is a jumble of things, as are the things that result from it. I’m a firm believer of the idea that anything can be polished into a gleaming peculiarity, and I’ve been blessed with the circumstance that I rarely get ideas, but, when I do, they’re usually pretty good. Sometimes they’re not, but usually they are. And if I grab onto them, they get polished to hell and back, every minutia sorted out and put in its place. So frustration arises when I either 1. can’t get any new ideas for me to shine or 2. lose my rag (metaphorically) and can’t find a way to clean up that last bit. I get really upset and depressed if I get into a creative rut. Thankfully, the former circumstance doesn’t happen all that often and it’s the latter that I have to worry about most of the time. My usual solution is to power through it by doing something else, but if I then get stuck there and need to go somewhere else again, and again, and again, the first problem rears its head; I’ve got a gaping abyss of anti-creativity ahead of me, and behind lies discarded, half-shined excrement. That’s bad. I’ve had that situation only once in my life, luckily, and that was right at the end of Freshman year. At that point, music was my main focus, larger than it is today, and I hit the same roadblock over and over again, which was that I was too ambitious. I wanted to get loads done, more than I could, and, despite having virtually limitless time, I never could really get around to doing anything because of how daunting it all was.</p>

<p margin="50">So I had a funk for the summer, and I came up with an idea. I had heard somewhere that restrictions bred creativity, so, when I had identified that I had tried to put too much on my plate at once, I gave it a shot. I gave myself prompts, like in timed writings, but for music. That didn’t work; they were half-baked things that worked me into a corner and ran their course after about a minute of material, if I was lucky. I needed something that I could bend, something that was nebulous about what I could do, but it also needed to be specific about what I couldn’t do; that was the whole point of a restriction, after all. One day, I came upon it, that single phrase: “Write nocturnes for piano.” There it was. I had a genre and a medium. I had a litany of references (hundreds of nocturnes must have been written) and, at the end of the day, nocturne was just a label that I could slap onto anything; there were clichés that came with the name like baggage, but I could wave any of them away, and I did. This worked wonders, and to this day, when I compose, I busy myself mostly with solo piano romantic literature.</p>

<p margin="50">So I came to French II, hopes not super high, ready to relegate it under that condemning moniker, “Free A Class.” But I had an idea, around the holiday season. The Mauvais germ spread across my mind, and I tugged at it, testing its flexibility. I brainstormed for a bit, and thought: “That phrase that got me going just a while ago for music, surely it’ll work here?” And I came up with an analogue: “Write noir in French.” I had the genre and the medium, the litany of references, the baggage, but also the freedom to bend the thing to my will. It was a perfect, to-scale model of my new relationship with music, but for literature, and for fun.</p>

<p margin="50">It served me, and it culminated with the fourth installment in the series, with the end of that year. But, by that point, I realized that the phrase was actually a bit too limiting. I had other ideas that simply wouldn’t fit in the world of Mauvais. The primary was a Three Musketeers sort of shtick, the polar opposite of Mauvais. Where the latter was dark, the former was light. Serious; comedic. Sarcastic; blatant. Smoky; perfectly clear. Poetic; direct. Prose; poetry. The main catch was that there was no way I could maintain periodicals like I had been doing with Mauvais at the same scale and keep my sanity. Then I had another idea, and another, and another. A bunch of these never left the drawing board, but two big ones did: the rap career and the trading card game.</p>

<p margin="50">I’m gonna take a short tangent and talk a bit about that trading card game. It’s really emblematic of my aforementioned “jumble” technique, of slapping together things from an impetus and surrounding stimuli. I found the brilliant art of the fellow named 【Rド】 a few years ago, when I was in a phase where I wanted to make video games. This was a short-lived desire that was crushed when I found out how difficult it was for me to do that (this website tested my limits, and that doesn’t speak well to my abilities at coding), but I had this thing where I was convinced that using that art was an idea that I can’t let go of, that it needs to be integrated into something where I can polish it. The hodge-podge mechanic that I was, that was the first concern; to find somewhere that it would fit. It’s a pretty clean summary of my process: find thing, investigate thing, find how to synthesize thing with other thing, polish ultimate thing.</p>

<p margin="50">Anyway, these ideas just would not fit under my umbrella, and I couldn’t bear to see them rot away in the rain of my apathy. So I did another one of my thinking shindigs over the summer and realized that my phrase wasn’t doing it. I had the opposite problem that I usually had, just when I was getting the previous state of affairs under control and streamlining my modus operandi. So how could I keep the essence of the phrase (nebulous “can-dos,” specific “can’t-dos”), but do it better? And I got it, just last month. “Write French.” Oh boy, what a terribly affronting thing to say it is, but I have to say it:</p>

<p margin="50">Those two words solved my problem. I was able to latch and ground all those whirling nuggets that pestered me day in and day out with those two words, which opened up a world while closing off everything unnecessary. For one, it was specifically French that I had to write. Not music (so the rap thing had to use someone else’s music, which was a big conundrum for me solved), not English (so that put to rest any clever conceptions of meta-language literature which I’m now convinced would have been horrific), and not art (I’m a terrible artist anyway. Formatting is different, and is actually the lifeblood of La Revue). As simple as that sounds, it turns out I only really needed to limit the medium to get the best environment for me. The idea of a short, biweekly release (La Revue) came along later, but I was sold as soon as I had it. It coincidentally helped me through my procrastination problem to a degree (“I’m gonna have to do this every two weeks! I can’t do it all the night before!”). It could be a hub, where I could test anything, as long as it was Written in French. That’s why I stress that so much when I ask for contributions: you can do anything, as long as you’re Writing French. My biggest hope, which will regrettably probably never come to fruition, is that someone will read those two words and have the same epiphany I had, and I can help someone solve the same problem I had. But, and I don’t say this to be arrogant, I haven’t yet met anyone who grasps so fervently onto the idea of making things as I do, so it’s probable that that dream is dashed.</p>

<p margin="50">Being able to call something your own is an incredible thing, regardless of how stupid it seems on the surface; that this entire debacle stemmed from me arbitrarily taking French I (I truly believe that it couldn’t have happened with any other language -- actually, if Italian were offered I'd probably be writing Mauvais: Mafia Edition, which Google Translate tells me would be Signore Cattivo, so maybe I wouldn't, or I'd find a more poetic title) is a testament to that. My favorite part of the process is, unlike what seems to be popular consensus among them “creative types,” not the actual making, but being able to look back at it and say “I made this. This is mine. See this sleek, glimmering, winking thing that makes you laugh and grin, that makes you admire and ponder? I was its conceiver. That was me.” It is unavoidably selfish, but here you are, enabling me by presumably enjoying what I’ve done enough to truck through enough of my overdesigned, overly figurative, overly self-centered drivel to build me a mountain to space. It’s also why I despise anything related to STEM, where all the baselines are already in place and I can’t get that dopamine rush that accompanies ganders at what I’ve created myself.</p>

<p margin="50">La Revue is probably the single most monumental thing to happen to me, moreso, I daresay, than when I found my love for music. It’s given me cause to think and reflect on what it is I do, and therefore what it is I am, more than anything else.</p>

<p margin="50">Writing French has taken me far. But now it's time for a revision, and one of my reasons for putting all this to text is to lay out the happenings and convince myself that I don't need that restriction anymore. La Revue will remain French literature and the trading card game (which is already stretching it), but I make no promises for the finale of L'Anthologie Mauvais Acte 1.</p>

<p margin="50">If one observes the butterfly effect (which I don’t, but I’ll make an exception here because this is a pretty clear thread), they’ll trace a path directly to French I and that close-my-eyes-and-point maneuver I did to get there. But I really can’t thank enough the two great enablers, Madame MacLaughlin and Madame Kanitz, whose simultaneously engrossing passion and lack of interference helped water this seed. Whose offhand comments about Ninjas of Grammar and Monsieurs Populaires gave it nutrients and light. Whose joy at seeing its previously invisible blossoms flower encouraged it to make more and more blooms, culminating in a psychedelic pinwheel of Towers of Fear, of Rap Battles, of Trading Cards. I can’t see a single other chain of events that might have led to me developing the way I have, the way I’m extremely happy with. Of course, I still have my shortcomings, and it’s already quite pretentious to be writing about these things when I’m not even a legal adult yet. However, it’s clear that the path behind me has been a good one. I don’t have fantastic foresight, but I suspect that the one ahead is dotted with many of the same flower that I leave here.</p><br>
